This GPT "May" does not store or collect any personal information from users.
Conversations are handled within the standard processing scope of OpenAI, and the developer side cannot store, reference, or reuse them.

GitHub OAuth authentication is used solely to grant users access to specific features of May (such as the Structure Layer and Resonance Layer). The only information obtained is the user's GitHub user ID and public profile information (with the read:user scope).

Authenticated information is used exclusively for access control during the session and is not used or stored for any other purpose.

May is designed for quiet and transparent interaction, with the utmost priority placed on respecting user data.

If you have any questions, please refer to the GitHub OAuth specification or OpenAI's platform policies.
